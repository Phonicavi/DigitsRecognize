# DigitsRecognize  
play with digits  

+ SHLNN training with an MNIST data-set to recognize simple digits..  

+ main referrence: mnielsen's [neural-networks-and-deep-learning](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)  

Know that:  

>  simple learning algorithm + good training data is better than sophisticated algorithm.
